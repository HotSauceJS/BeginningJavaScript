# Exercises

Here are some fun exercises for you to try with booleans, numbers, strings, and conditionals.  

An exercise will look like this:

    // Given two numbers, a and b, display the larger of the two
    
    var a = 5;
    var b = 9;
    
    // your code goes here
      console.log(b);
    // your code goes here
      console.log(b);

In which I have full confidence in your abilities to create a program like this:

    // Given two numbers, a and b, display the larger of the two
    
    var a = 5;
    var b = 9;
    
    if (a > b)
      console.log(a);
    else
      console.log(b);

To test your answer, run your file

    > node 00_max.js

Experiment with the values and see what you can change, modify, and expand.

If you run into any trouble, let me know.

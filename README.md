# Beginning JavaScript

Aww yeah, these are Greg &amp; Dustin's Beginning JavaScript class files.

You'll find individual lessons in each directory. 

Notes for the whole class are available in the cheatsheets directory.

## Installing Node

For this class we use node to run our JavaScript.  

First, we need to install the software by visiting http://nodejs.org.

Installers are available for Mac and Windows, but linux users will
need to build it themselves or use a package management tool.

Instructions for Linux package managers are available here: https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager
